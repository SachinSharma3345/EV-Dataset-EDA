# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

This project explores the distribution and trends of electric vehicles using real-world data. The analysis is performed using Python and visualized through Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Model year distribution of electric vehicles
- Comparison of vehicle types (BEV, PHEV) using KDE and histogram plots
- Use of `hue`, `palette`, and other Seaborn customization features
- Insights into vehicle trends over the years

## 📁 Files

- `Electric_Vehicle_Popluation.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with visualizations and analysis
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Seaborn 🎨
- Matplotlib 📈

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- **Seaborn `kde`**: Visualizing the probability density function
- **Hue**: Grouping data visually using color
- **Palette**: Customizing the color scheme for better aesthetics

## 🚀 Getting Started
